/*Write a function shoutGreetings() that takes in an array of strings and returns a new array. This new array should contain all the strings from the argument array but with capitalized letters and an exclamation point appended to the end: 'heya' will become 'HEYA!'

You can use any technique you want to accomplish this task.

You can test your function when youâ€™re ready by passing in the greetings array or by making your own array! */

const shoutGreetings = arr => arr.map(word => word.toUpperCase() + '!')
